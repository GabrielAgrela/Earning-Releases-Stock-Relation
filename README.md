# Earning Releases And Stock Price Relation
In this project I try to find relations between the r/wallstreetbets Earning Releases weekly infographic and the stock prices of the companies in it.
Example of infographic: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jppepz/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the_week/
Sheet (used as database) where I move the data of each infographic to: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TyUw5Ip6AYDynLIHGatVj4FmC2ekkT1thnrIgAXSycU/edit#gid=0
